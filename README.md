Autism is a neurological disorder which impacts oneâ€™s social interaction and communication. It causes unusual behaviour and interest of the being. Diseases such as Autism and Dyslexia has no permanent cure but it can be treated with some proper therapies.

The common symptoms which tells us that people is suffering from autism is :-

Lack of eye contact
Doing repetitive actions and behaviours,
Experiencing matters with the forward and backward of discussion
Preferring to communicate in single words, rather than being able to speak in sentences
Doesn't express feelings or sentiments
Seems to does not bother for other's emotions and only participate in a restricted range of activities.
The autistic brain differs from normal brain. It is larger in size than the normal brain. It mainly focuses on corpus collosum. Minicolumns that organizes neurons in cortical space. Cortical space are made up of hundreds and millions of minicolumns . It involves the three main steps

segmenting the corpus collosum from the MRI image
finding the outer layer of corpus collosum
finding the length of the corpus collosum.
In 2020, the CDC reported that approximately 1 in 54 children in the U.S. is diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), according to the report - 1 in 34 boys identified with autism, 1 in 144 girls identified with autism and boys are four times more likely to be diagnosed with autism than girls. Most children were still being diagnosed after age 4, though autism can be reliably diagnosed as early as age 2.

The diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a subjective process requiring clinical expertise in neurodevelopmental disorders. Since such expertise is not available at many clinics, automated diagnosis using machine learning (ML) algorithms would be of great value to both clinicians and the imaging community to increase the diagnoses availability and reproducibility while reducing subjectivity. Our idea is to use machine learning methodologies for the identification of autism by weights of corpus collosum.
